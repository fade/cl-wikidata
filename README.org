* This project defines a Common Lisp interface to the Wikidata SPARQL query endpoint.

- there’s not that much to the interface… you GET https://query.wikidata.org/sparql?query=SELECT...&format=json, basically
- or a few other formats, and if you don’t specify a format in the parameters then the Accept header is respected
- if the query is overly long you can also use POST instead of GET
- there’s some more documentation at https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/REST_API but not all of it applies to WDQS (e.g. there’s no public INSERT/DELETE/etc.)
- (oh, and always include a User-Agent header or your request will get blocked somewhere in the traffic layer. see https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_policy)
- the query service UI can also show code examples for how to use the query service from several languages
- once you publish your library, maybe we can add a Common Lisp example for it 8)
